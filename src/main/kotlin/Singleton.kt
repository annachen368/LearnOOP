/**
 * This is a singleton object in Kotlin.
 * It can be used to hold global state or utility functions.
 *
 * The Singleton pattern is crucial because it helps you manage shared resources more efficiently.
 * For example, think of scenarios like logging, configuration settings,
 * or database connections â€” these are areas where you typically need only one instance.
 *
 * It provides thread safety and lazy loading by default:
 * Lazy loading: This means that the Singleton instance is not created until it is first needed,
 * which can save resources and increase efficiency.
 *
 * Thread safety: Ensures that even in multithreaded environments, there is no risk of creating multiple instances of
 * the Singleton.
