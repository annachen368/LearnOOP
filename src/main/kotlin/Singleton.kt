 * This is a singleton object in Kotlin.
 * It can be used to hold global state or utility functions.
 *
 * The Singleton pattern is crucial because it helps you manage shared resources more efficiently.
 * For example, think of scenarios like logging, configuration settings,
 * or database connections â€” these are areas where you typically need only one instance.
